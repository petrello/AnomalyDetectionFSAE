# 🏎️ Anomaly Detection for FSAE EVs using Dynamic Bayesian Networks


**Author: [Tommaso Petrelli](https://github.com/petrello/)**

This repository contains the implementation of a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) for detecting inverter faults in Formula SAE electric vehicles. Trained on real-world telemetry data from UniBo Motorsport's Athena EV, this project explores the capabilities and limitations of DBNs in modeling normal vehicle behavior and identifying anomalies in critical drivetrain components.

Key features:
- Telemetry data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Custom DBN implementation using pgmpy
- Log-likelihood scoring for anomaly detection
- Performance analysis and visualization tools
